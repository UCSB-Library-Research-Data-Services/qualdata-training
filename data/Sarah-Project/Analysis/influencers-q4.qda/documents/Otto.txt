﻿Oh man, ethics in the digital world? It really feels like the Wild West out there! (laughs) When folks buy followers or get obsessed with vanity metrics, they totally miss out on those genuine connections. Authentic engagement isn’t just a quick win—it takes time and effort. It’s all about being present, responding to comments, and really listening to what your followers are saying.

Creating a space where people feel valued and heard is what matters most, not just seeing them as another number on a page. Unfortunately, some people lose sight of that and end up with their priorities all mixed up. It’s a shame because real connections are where the magic happens!

I should acknowledge that the social media landscape has definitely seen some more rigid regulations. We have had some post and content labeling regulations in place for a couple of years now, and while we see inconsistencies across profiles and niches, still, whenever I promote a product or a service, I always make sure to label it as sponsored clearly. My followers need to know when I’m getting paid to push something. Nobody likes feeling like they’ve been duped, right?

We know this is how social media marketing works. For example, if I post a clip of me enjoying a cocktail at a swanky resort in Bali, you bet there’s going to be a spike in bookings and people wanting to try that same drink. It’s a direct line from my experience to their actions.

Back to ethics, though—I always tag my posts as sponsored and share a bit about how the partnership came about. Transparency is key to keeping that genuine connection with my audience. But it's not just on me. Brands also have a role here. They need to be upfront and deliver on their promises. I had a situation where a product I endorsed had quality issues shortly after launch. I addressed it openly with my followers and showed that the brand was working to fix the problem. It’s crucial for both sides to be accountable.

That said, followers also need to be a bit savvy. There’s this tendency to blame influencers if they end up overspending or buying something that doesn’t meet their expectations. But honestly, it’s a two-way street. My followers should think critically and not just buy into everything they see. If they feel a product isn’t worth it or isn’t good quality, that’s not solely on me. They should do their own research, assess their needs, and make informed decisions.

So, I should say It’s all about trust and transparency. I aim to be honest and genuine with my endorsements, and I expect the brands I work with to do the same. But followers also need to be discerning and responsible in their purchasing decisions. It’s a partnership where everyone has a role to play.
