﻿Being responsible in the digital influencer space means being mindful of the broader impact of consumerism and its effect on the planet. We need to strike a balance between sharing exciting finds and promoting thoughtful consumption. It’s about encouraging our followers to make choices that are both stylish and sustainable. My mission as a digital influencer is to offer possibilities without driving impulsive shopping.

I find that my work, and the work of many other influencers who inspire me, takes a different approach from the mainstream. While some influencers focus heavily on driving sales and exploiting the platform, I aim to do something different. It’s everywhere you look—sometimes in your face, sometimes more subtly—but I don’t agree with it.

For me, it’s crucial to consider the broader careless and fast consumption. Balancing the excitement of discovering new finds with promoting responsible practices and supporting environmental sustainability is key.

When I endorse a company or brand, it’s because I genuinely believe in its mission. If a product or service doesn’t align with my focus on slow fashion and conscious consumption, I won’t promote it just to make a sale. My followers appreciate my honest opinions because they know I’m not just pushing products for the sake of it.

A recent example of this is my collaboration with a fantastic service that focuses on recycling and repurposing old clothing. They offer a program where you can send in your unwanted clothes, and they either upcycle them into new items or ensure they’re recycled properly. I featured their service in a series of posts, showing how the process works and highlighting its positive environmental impact.

The feedback from my followers was incredibly positive. Many were excited to discover a practical way to responsibly dispose of their old clothes and appreciated the transparency and environmental impact of the service. It sparked conversations about sustainable fashion and encouraged people to think more about their own recycling practices.

Collaborating with a service like this supports a brand doing good for the environment and empowers my audience to make more sustainable choices. It’s about promoting responsible consumption and inspiring actions that benefit both style and the planet.
