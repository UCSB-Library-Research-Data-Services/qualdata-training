﻿Yeah, that is a very good question! The biggest thing is honesty and transparency. For instance, I always make sure to let my followers know when a post is sponsored or if I’ve received a product for free. It’s all about being upfront so people know what’s genuine and what’s part of a partnership.

There was a time I worked with a brand on a home decor line. I was excited about it, but I made it clear that it was a sponsored post. My followers appreciated the transparency and it helped maintain their trust.

Authenticity is also key for me. I only promote products that I genuinely like and would use myself. For example, if I’m recommending a specific brand of paint, it’s because I’ve used it and seen real results. If it’s not something I’d use or recommend to a friend, it doesn’t make it to my feed.

I once had an opportunity to promote a product that didn’t quite fit with my usual style or content. I decided to pass on it because it wouldn’t have felt right or genuine. My followers would’ve seen through it, and I didn’t want to risk their trust.

Being responsible to my audience means making sure the content I put out is accurate and useful. Like when I reviewed a new cleaning product, I shared both the pros and cons because it didn’t work as well as advertised. My followers valued that honest feedback.

I also make sure to respect privacy and handle data carefully. I’m cautious about sharing personal information and choose tools and platforms that manage user data responsibly. If a tool has questionable privacy practices, I avoid using it.

A good example is when I was choosing a new platform for managing my email list. I found one that seemed great, but when I read their privacy policy, I realized they had some practices that didn’t sit right with me. 

They were collecting more data than necessary and didn’t provide clear options for opting out. I decided to go with a different platform that had stronger privacy controls and more transparent policies.

It’s important to me that my followers’ data is protected and handled responsibly. I don’t want to be associated with any service that doesn’t prioritize data security. So, I always do my homework and choose tools that align with my values with respect to privacy.

So, you know, keeping everything transparent and genuine is crucial for building my digital community and maintaining trust with my viewers.
