﻿I’ve turned down several sponsorship opportunities for products or services that I didn’t personally use or believe in. For instance, I was approached by a company to promote a financial product that I felt didn’t offer genuine value to my followers. I chose not to endorse it, as I wanted to ensure that my recommendations were based on real experiences and beneficial to my audience.

I make it a priority to disclose any potential conflicts of interest. For example, if I discuss a product that I have a financial stake in, I clearly mention this to my audience. This transparency helps avoid any perception of bias and maintains the integrity of my recommendations.

Unfortunately, this ethical principle seems to be lacking in today's landscape. Many influencers fail to uphold their promises when selling products or services, both directly and indirectly. As a result, many people are understandably frustrated. 

For my own products and courses, I ensure that users have access to reliable technical assistance and support. It’s also crucial to meet their expectations by delivering on the promises made. This means providing clear, actionable content and being responsive to any issues or questions that arise. By doing so, I uphold the integrity of my offerings and ensure that my audience receives the value they were promised. 

I also don’t have an issue with coming forward and rectifying things when necessary. There have definitely been times when I needed to clarify or correct information I shared. In the investment space, it’s crucial to provide accurate and reliable advice, and sometimes things change or I realize I didn’t present something clearly enough.

For instance, there was a time I recommended a particular investment strategy, but after doing further research, I realized it wasn’t as effective as I initially thought. I made it a point to address this with my followers, explaining my updated perspective and the reasoning behind it. Transparency is key in building trust with my audience, especially in a field where people are making financial decisions based on my 
insights.

I believe it’s important for influencers to be accountable and show that we’re all learning and growing. Admitting when we’re wrong not only helps to maintain credibility but also fosters a more honest dialogue within the community. Ultimately, I want my followers to feel confident in their investment choices, and being upfront about any missteps is part of that commitment.
