﻿That’s a really good question. In the world of digital influencing, there are definitely some key ethical standards that we should follow. For one, being upfront about transparency is huge. If I’m endorsing a product, I always make it clear if it’s a sponsored post or if I’m using affiliate links. I use hashtags like #ad or #sponsored so my followers know when there’s a financial connection. It’s all about keeping things honest and maintaining trust.

Authenticity is another big one. I only promote products that I genuinely believe in and actually use myself. I wouldn’t want to push something just for a quick paycheck. For example, there was a chance to promote a supplement brand, but after looking into it, I felt it didn’t match my personal health values. So, I turned it down. It’s important to stay true to what you believe in and what’s best for your audience.

Honesty in reviews is also crucial. I aim to give a balanced view of any product I’m talking about. If there are any drawbacks or things that might not work for everyone, I make sure to mention them. Like, when I reviewed a new workout gadget, I talked about its benefits but also pointed out its size and price. Being upfront helps my followers make informed decisions and keeps the trust strong.

And then there’s the need to consider the impact of the products I’m promoting. I try to focus on brands that are not just good but also have positive values, like sustainability or ethical practices. For instance, I’ve promoted reusable water bottles from a company that’s really committed to reducing plastic waste. It’s about aligning promotions with values that matter to me and my audience.

Interviewer: Those are great points. Do you have any specific examples?

Interviewee: Definitely. There was a time when I was offered a big sponsorship deal to promote a weight loss supplement. After checking it out, I found it made some claims that seemed too good to be true and didn’t have solid scientific backing. I decided to pass on the deal, even though it was tempting financially. I explained my decision to my followers, and they really appreciated the honesty. It reinforced the importance of staying authentic and responsible.

Another example is when I promoted a brand of reusable water bottles. I chose them because they’re all about cutting down on plastic waste and have strong ethical practices. By highlighting not just the product but also the company’s mission, I was able to align my promotion with my personal values and those of my audience. 

You know, I think it’s crucial to keep ethics front and center in this space. It’s all about building trust and staying true to what you believe in while promoting products that genuinely align with your values.

Honestly, I think it boils down to a few core principles: transparency, honesty, and responsibility. When we’re out here recommending products, it’s super important to be upfront about any partnerships or sponsorships. For me, that means tagging posts with “#ad” or “#sponsored” so everyone knows what’s going on behind the scenes.

I’m a big believer in doing my homework before I promote anything. I check out the ingredients, look into how the product is made, and if I’m unsure about anything, I’ll consult with experts. For example, before I endorsed a new supplement, I made sure to research it thoroughly and even had a chat with a nutritionist to make sure it was legit.

There was this one time I was offered a deal with a fitness gadget company, but after looking into it, I felt their claims were a bit too good to be true. I didn’t want to mislead my followers, so I passed on it. Instead, I focused on promoting something that I truly believed in and knew was going to be beneficial.

So, I try to be as educational as possible. I’ll break down how to read product labels, what certain terms actually mean, and give them tips on spotting marketing fluff. I did a whole series on understanding supplement labels because I think it's crucial for people to know what they’re putting into their bodies. It’s all about giving them the tools to make smart choices. At the end of the day, it’s all about trust. I want my followers to know that when I’m recommending something, it’s because I genuinely believe in it and have done my due diligence. It’s not just about selling products—it’s about supporting and educating my community.
