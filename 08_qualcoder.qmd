## What is QualCoder?

![](images/qualcoder-logo.png){fig-align="left" width="150"}

QualCoder is client-based open-source and free multi-platform tool designed to streamline qualitative data analysis. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, QualCoder empowers researchers and analysts to efficiently organize, code, and analyze qualitative data, ranging from text documents to multimedia files. By providing tools for coding, categorizing, and retrieving data, QualCoder facilitates in-depth exploration and interpretation, enabling researchers to uncover meaningful insights and patterns, and extract rich and nuanced information from their qualitative data.

With QualCoder you can code text, images, audio and video, write journal notes and memos. You can categorize codes into a tree-like hierarchical categorization scheme. Coding for audio and video requires the [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html). Coder comparison reports can be generated for text coding using the Cohen’s Kappa statistic for interrater/intercoder reliability (**FIXME:** mchugh2012interrater) measuring the level of agreement between coders. A graph displaying codes and categories can be generated to visualize the coding hierarchy. Most reports can be exported as html, open document text (ODT) or as plain text files.

Documentation:

-   Wiki - <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/wiki>

-   GitHub Repository - <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder>

-   GitHub Repository (QualCoder AI - beta) - <https://github.com/kaixxx/QualCoder/tree/ai_integration>

You are welcome to follow [installation and running instructions](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/wiki/01-Introduction) for your operating system. Please note, however, this is a multistep process that requires additional components and the use of the command line/terminal. We are available to consult with individuals or groups that require assistance in that process.

To save us time, for this workshop we will skip the installation process and we will be supplying a virtual machine to attendees. We will first use the latest available version on the software (currently 3.5) for the exercises, and then, give a sneak peak of the beta version with AI capabilities to test how ChatGPT 4.0 can assist with horizontal coding. On this second half, we will discuss the implications for privacy and also the expected costs associated with the use of AI.

### Launching QualCoder

To run QualCoder from the command prompt or terminal use the following

*Mac* From any directory: `qualcoder` From the QualCoder-Master directory: `python3 -m qualcoder` or `python3 qualcoder/__main__.py`

*Windows* From the command prompt: `py -m qualcoder`

### Basic Functionalities

We will cover some basic settings, terms (attributes, including how to create a project and how to engage with coding. If you are following this content asynchronously, we strongly advise you to watch the following video for additional features:

#### Anatomy of a QualCoder Project

In QualCoder, *projects* serve as containers for organizing multiple files, cases, and attributes. Each project allows you to manage and analyze a specific set of qualitative data, keeping everything organized. You can create different projects for distinct research questions or datasets, enabling a streamlined workflow. This structure ultimately helps you delve deeper into your analysis without mixing different data sets.

Understanding the roles of files, attributes and cases and their relationships is key to most QDA software. In QualCoder, *files* refer to the individual documents or data sources you import for analysis. You may have more than one file associate with a unique case. *Cases* are specific units of analysis, often linked to files, that allow you to organize and explore your data in a more detailed manner. Together, they create a structured environment for qualitative analysis, allowing you to delve into themes and patterns effectively. In our project example, the cases will consist of individual interviewees, but we could also focus on the niche they belong to if we were to analyze at that level.

For example, let’s imagine that Sarah also collected social media video posts from content creators and digital influencers to analyze behaviors beyond participants’ self-reports, by also checking how they have been engaging with their followers. In this case, she can add video clips to QualCoder and associate them with the same research participant. This structure will depend on the nature of your project, allowing for flexibility in how data is organized and analyzed to best capture the insights you seek.

*Attributes* are metadata or characteristics that can be assigned to files and cases, helping to categorize or describe them. Examples related to our project example could be demographic pieces of information (e.g., gender, age group), years active, niche, total followers assigned to individuals represented as cases, or characteristics attributed to a file such as the type of source (e.g., interview, social media), total numbers of views, shares and comments, platform (e.g., IG, Youtube, TikTok). You may take advantage of *memos* to record more detailed information about attributes. Think of it an essential aid to documentation that will provide better contextualization so researchers, including your future self, can better interpret and understand decisions made during the research process.

As a heads up, QualCoder was not designed having statistical analysis of attributes in mind, for that, you can export attributes as csv files and use R or other open dedicated application. Also, the only current options for attributes are numeric and character, so dates, types or integers are not supported. To export attributes, use the icon below or

You can utilize *Journals* to practice data journaling anddocument ideas and reflections throughout the coding process, making them searchable with regex expressions—a topic we'll explore later. Journals are particularly useful for a bottom-up approaches, requiring multiple iterations to refine your themes and coding scheme. Plus, you can enhance your journaling content with markdown formatting!

#### Practicing with the Case Example

Now that we are more familiar with QualCoder's interface, some key functions and the mechanics of setting up a project, let's bring Sarah's data into QualCoder and create a project. We will then, walk her through the process of coding her interview transcripts using some recommended practices.

##### Creating a Project

Project \> Create New Project

Select the directory you want to save your qda project and name it `Influencers`.

##### Loading Files

We've created a project, but we don't have any files yet, so let's load them now.
