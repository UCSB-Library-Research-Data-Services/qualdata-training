## What is QualCoder?

![](images/qualcoder-logo.png){fig-align="left" width="150"}

QualCoder is client-based open-source and free multi-platform tool designed to streamline qualitative data analysis. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, QualCoder empowers researchers and analysts to efficiently organize, code, and analyze qualitative data, ranging from text documents to multimedia files. By providing tools for coding, categorizing, and retrieving data, QualCoder facilitates in-depth exploration and interpretation, enabling researchers to uncover meaningful insights and patterns, and extract rich and nuanced information from their qualitative data.

With QualCoder you can code text, images, audio and video, write journal notes and memos. You can categorize codes into a tree-like hierarchical categorization scheme. Coding for audio and video requires the [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html). Coder comparison reports can be generated for text coding using the Cohenâ€™s Kappa statistic for interrater/intercoder reliability (**FIXME:** mchugh2012interrater) measuring the level of agreement between coders. A graph displaying codes and categories can be generated to visualize the coding hierarchy. Most reports can be exported as html, open document text (ODT) or as plain text files.

Documentation:

-   Wiki - <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/wiki>

-   GitHub Repository - <https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder>

-   GitHub Repository (QualCoder AI - beta) - <https://github.com/kaixxx/QualCoder/tree/ai_integration>

You are welcome to follow [installation and running instructions](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/wiki/01-Introduction) for your operating system. Please note, however, this is a multistep process that requires additional components and the use of the command line/terminal. We are available to consult with individuals or groups that require assistance in that process.

To save us time, for this course we will skip the installation process and we will be using a virtual machine. We will first use the latest available version on the software (currently 3.5) for the exercises, and then, explore the beta version with AI capabilities to test how ChatGPT 4.0 can assist with horizontal coding. On this second half, we will discuss the implications for privacy and also the expected costs associated with the use of AI.

### **Basic Functionalities**

Let's now explore a few helpful basic functionalities by navigating the wikipage. We will cover some basic settings, terms (attributes, including how to create a project and how to engage with coding. If you are following this content asynchronously, we strongly advise you to watch the following video for additional features:

### Practicing Code

Now that we are more familiar with QualCoder interface, the mechanics of setting up a project and using some basic features, let's bring Sarah's data into Qualcoder and walk her through the process of coding her interview transcripts.
