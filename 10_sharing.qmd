## Sharing with Caring

Before we dive into what researchers should share and where. Let's try
something together.

# ðŸ’­ **Discussion:** Evaluating Data Deposits

Please open the links to the two data deposits below:

Taherzadeh, O., 2016, "Interview Transcripts", *Interview Transcripts*,
<https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/4C9KFK/XRREIY>, Harvard Dataverse, V1

Klein, M., 2022. *Interview transcripts of addiction therapists and
recovering drug service users.* Bath: University of Bath Research Data
Archive. Available from: <https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-01096>.

Can you spot any differences? Supposing those were both topics related
to your research, how likely would you be to reuse one dataset versus
another? Why?

**Context and Documentation**

-   Taherzadeh (2016): This deposit lacks detailed contextual
    information about the study, such as the sample, interview
    questions, study goals, or informed consent details. It is a
    standalone collection of transcripts.

-   Klein (2022): This deposit provides clearer context, the objectives
    of the research and questions asked, and links to the associated
    dissertation.

**Reuse Value**

Taherzadeh (2016) Dataset: Low

-   The absence of context and supporting documentation makes it
    challenging to assess the datasetâ€™s validity, reliability, and
    relevance to other research. Without knowing the background or how
    the data was collected, it's difficult to justify its use in further
    studies.

Klein (2022): Higher

-   The dataset seems to come with comprehensive documentation,
    including context about the participants and the study goals. This
    information facilitates a better understanding of how to apply the
    data effectively in new research, making it much more reusable.

## Considerations on What to Share

Remember when we discussed the importance of outlining data-sharing
plans in Data Management Plans (DMPs)? At this stage, Sarah could
greatly benefit from having a clear strategy for archiving and storing
her data. As we mentioned earlier, understanding the available options
and having at least a rough plan for what will be shared, along with
strategies to facilitate the process, is crucial. We provided Sarah with
recommendations on what to document, and we hope this guidance will
empower her to share her research deliverables confidently while
adhering to key principles of open practices.

Also it is important to recap the importance of balancing the value of
open sharing against the risks of harms associated with the
identification of participants, communities and research sites. The good
news is that there are more options in between closed and open access!

Depending on your project needs and what was promised

-   Before sharing the files:
    <https://managing-qualitative-data.org/modules/3/b/> (types of
    access controls)

-   When possible, consider sharing de-identified transcripts openly,
    while placing recordings under more stringent access controls.

-   Do keep a list of de-identification rules, both for yourself, or for
    your team should you collaborate. This list serves as important
    documentation when you share your data. See for example the protocol
    used by Thad Dunning and Edward Camp to de-identify data deposited
    with the Qualitative Data Repository. This document is separate from
    the key that links de-identified entries to the actual individuals
    or entities interviewed, which should not be included when you share
    your data.

-   Do check the document properties of files, which may contain
    identifiers such as original file names identifying interview
    respondents.

-   Finally, do try to strike a balance between keeping your
    participantsâ€™ information confidential and unnecessarily reducing
    the analytic value of the data by removing too much information. If
    you are having difficulties striking that balance, you could ask
    another subject-matter expert for assistance; some repository
    personnel or data librarians can also provide abstract rules that
    you can follow.

## What data?

ICPSR's Guide for Sharing Qualitative Data outlines examples of of
qualitative data sources that may be archived for secondary analysis:

â€¢ Interview methods, including those captured through notes, audio, and
video

-   In-depth and/or unstructured interviews

-   Semi-structured interviews

-   Focus group interviews

â€¢ Diary studies that are unstructured or use semi-structured writing
prompts

â€¢ Observational studies that generate field notes and other text and
information

-   Naturalistic observation of real-world environments (e.g.,
    classrooms, workplaces, healthcare facilities, courtrooms, public
    spaces)

-   Participant observation where the researcher becomes an active part
    of the setting to collect information (e.g., online gaming,
    community policing, nightclub culture)

-   Structured observation is where the research has predefined
    objectives and a systemic approach to collecting information. This
    would include case studies.

â€¢ Text from available sources

-   Meeting minutes

-   Official records Medical records

-   News sources and social media

-   Excerpts of copyrighted materials (e.g., literature, film, music)

â€¢ Survey methods or questionnaires with substantial open-ended comments

## Where should you share your project Data

Not locally

Preferably In a stable and curated

## Choosing a Data Repository

Special considerations for Qualitative Data need to be taken into
account.

## Preparing your data for Submission

### Documenting your Data

Required:

-   Original source data, whenever possible, and as long as it is
    de-identified

-   Processed data (e.g., transcripts)

-   Codebook

-   Coded Data

-   Readme

-   Instrument for data collection (e.g., survey, interview, etc), if
    applicable

-   Documentation generated in the Qualitative Data Analysis Software
    (QDAS) application: memos, notes, networks, classifications

Recommended:

-   Informed consent statement(s) or assent (see the Human Subjects Data
    Essentials Primer)

-   IRB protocol (see the Human Subjects Data Essentials Primer)

-   Study protocol or procedures manual

-   Data Management Plan --To indicate how long the data needs to be
    preserved/accessible, and any other stipulations on
    sharing/management.
